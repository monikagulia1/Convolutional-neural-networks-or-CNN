# Convolutional-neural-networks-or-CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural network primarily used for image and spatial data processing. They excel in recognizing patterns, textures, and spatial hierarchies within data, making them ideal for tasks like image and video recognition, medical image analysis, and even time series analysis.

Here are the key components of CNNs:

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply a set of filters (kernels) that slide over the input data. Each filter extracts specific features, like edges or textures, creating feature maps that represent parts of the image in various ways. Convolutions help CNNs retain spatial relationships, which are essential for accurate pattern recognition.
Pooling Layers: Pooling reduces the spatial dimensions of feature maps, which cuts down on the number of parameters, lessens computation, and prevents overfitting. Common pooling methods include max pooling and average pooling.
Fully Connected Layers: After convolutional and pooling layers, the network includes fully connected (dense) layers that consolidate extracted features and form final predictions. They connect every neuron from the last convolutional layer to each neuron in the output layer.
Activation Functions: Most CNNs use the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function in their layers, introducing non-linearity to allow the network to learn complex patterns.
Dropout (Optional): To prevent overfitting, dropout layers are sometimes added to randomly deactivate neurons during training. This encourages the network to learn a more generalized set of features.
