# Convolutional-neural-networks-or-CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural network primarily used for image and spatial data processing. They excel in recognizing patterns, textures, and spatial hierarchies within data, making them ideal for tasks like image and video recognition, medical image analysis, and even time series analysis.
